# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '12'
    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - run: |
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        echo "${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        ssh-keyscan "${{ secrets.HOST }}" >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        ssh ${{ secrets.USER }}@${{ secrets.HOST }} 'cd ${{ secrets.PATH }} && git pull && npm install && forever restart index.js'
